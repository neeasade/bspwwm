This is vaporware right now. I'm playing with this mostly from emacs with inferior lisp mode, currently just trying to MVP with the tinywl example from wlroots.

Taking a lot of inspiration (and initial code!) from [[https://github.com/telent/fenestra][fenestra]]. Using luajit for it's FFI/to stay close to upstream, using fennel so we can have buffer repl magic.

If you have nix, you can test the build with:

#+begin_src console
$ nix-shell
$ make
$ ./bspwwm
#+end_src

bspwwm = binary space partioning (wayland/wlroots) window manager
