** bspwwm

bspwwm = binary space partioning (wayland/wlroots) window manager, IE wayland [[https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm][bspwm]].

*This is vaporware right now*. I'm playing with this mostly from emacs with inferior lisp mode, currently just trying to MVP with the tinywl example from wlroots.

Taking a lot of inspiration (and initial code!) from [[https://github.com/telent/fenestra][fenestra]]. Using luajit for it's FFI, using fennel so we can have buffer repl magic.

** notes:

- using lorri for nix-shell direnv integration, which I then sync with emacs using emacs-direnv
- lorri is constantly rebuilding right now, so enabling the service selectively.

** building
If you have nix, you can test the build with:

#+begin_src console
$ nix-shell
$ make
$ ./bspwwm
#+end_src
