** bspwwm

bspwwm = binary space partioning (wayland/wlroots) window manager, IE wayland [[https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm][bspwm]].

*This is vaporware right now*. I'm playing with this mostly from emacs with inferior lisp mode, currently just trying to MVP with the tinywl example from wlroots.

** notes
- clojure -> jnr -> wlroots -> wayland-server
- nix-shell with lorri to setup the environment dependencies
- a script to get the headers isolated per library/shared object that we care about (strategy ripped from [[https://github.com/telent/fenestra][fenestra]])

** building

Nothing yet. Just Mx ~cider-jack-in~ and play around.
